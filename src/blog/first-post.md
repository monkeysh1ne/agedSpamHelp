## Ever had a phone call where you thought this just feels off?

Is the caller saying that something has happened or will happen that requires your urgent attention to avoid dire consequences?  Are they asking you to install software on your computer?

These are the hallmarks of a scam call.  Here's what to do and some advice.

Ask them for their name, the business they are calling from, and a contact number.

Hang up.

Go to your computer and search for the business then, crucially, check the contact telephone numbers listed for that business.  Do any of them check with the one your caller gave?

Yes - great!  You may have a legitimate call although no legitimate business will ask you to install software on your computer so if this is the case I'd recommend you still ignore the call.  They are likely trying to get you to install software that will grant them remote access to your computer with the goal of accessing your bank accounts to pay themselves.

No? - I thought so.  Ignore the call, it's a scam call.
