      <h1 class="section-title">Welcome to Aged Spam Help!</h1>
      <p>
        I set this site up as a response to the repeated attempts my elderly mum
        faced from scammers - emails, texts and phone calls.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I hope to provide here are some simple tools and snippets of advice
        to help anyone, but especially elderly members of our communities, fight
        and stay protected from becoming victim to a scammer.
